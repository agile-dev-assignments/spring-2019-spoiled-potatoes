#### A music review site

## Description
This web-based platform allows music fans to monitor and vote on their favorite albums, EPs, songs and musical works. The home page displays music reviews filtered by artist, year, most controversial, most popular and other criteria. Users have the capability to add music for review and vote on other music previously submitted. This product is meant to be the one-stop-shop for music fans to express their opinions and discover new music.


## Motivation
It is increasingly common for music fans to want to share their opinion. We are aware of this trend and decided to make a platform where users can share those opinions, become more engaged with the music they listen to and, hopefully, discover new music along the way. With our platform, we hope to foster a community in which both avid music enthusiasts and the general public can voice their opinions and benefit from those of others.
