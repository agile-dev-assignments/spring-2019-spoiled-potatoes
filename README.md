# Trading Dashboard
#### A unique dashboard for all your investment portfolios
#### A business intelligence tool for data visualizations 

## Description
This web-based platform allows traders to monitor their investments across all brokerages and accounts. With advancements in financial technology, most popular brokerages provide REST APIs for their customers. The dashboard compiles all relevant information into a series of visualizations, charts and tables. There is no limit to the amount of accounts that can be added to the platform, and the dashboard has capabilities to break down the analysis for individual accounts. This product is meant to the (open-source) one-stop-shop for traders that would like to keep track of their investments using.


## Motivation
It is common practice for retail (non-institutional) traders to use multiple brokers and accounts for their investments. While this is beneficial for financial purposes, it becomes harder to holistically monitor all of your investments. Not only does it become harder to asses risk levels and potential return, but each brokerage has their own API. In order to help solve this issue, we have decided to come up with this trading dashboard. The utility of this product comes from its design and simplicity. 

## Why dashboard? Why data dashboard for business analytics?

Throughout the discovery and meaningful interpretation of patterns in data, we aim to use analytics, relied upon the simultaneous application of statistics, computer programming and operations research to quantify performance. We choose to use data visualization to communicate insight. 

## What are we going to do with the data visualization tool?

Dashboards is a business intelligence tool that would display data visualizations for users to understand immediately. For entrepreneur, startups, dashboard would serve as a more readable yet precise version to help business analysis and future decision makings. For non-technical users, dashboards would provide a process of data transformation and investments trends.
