## Style Guidelines

We try to stick to [Airbnb's JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) to maintain clean code. Please raise any styling errors that you find as an issue on GitHub.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build. This should be handled by .gitignore, and more details on this will be added in the future.

2. Update the README.md, if necessary, to document any changes you've made.

3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have passed all checks and have the sign-off of all other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request a reviewer to merge it for you.

## Team Norms

1. The definition of done
    * Must fulfill acceptance criteria
    * Must pass all auto-tests
    * Must be reviewed by other developers

2. Sprint cadence
    * All sprints will be completed by the due date listed on GitHub
    * Due to the fact that this is based on class deadlines,there is not much leeway on this pacing, so please reach out if you are having trouble hitting deadlines

3. Standups schedule
    * Standups will tentatively be held every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon in person, and also twice over the phone whenever everyone is available.
    * Standups will usually last about 10 minutes
    * If for any reason you are unable to attend these standups, please inform the maintainers/team members so that we may plan ahead

4. Failure to deliver
    * We are all very busy people with many other obligations outside of this project; please keep this in mind when communicating with your team members
    * Everyone is expected to contribute equally on this project, and no one should have/feel as though they have more work than other developers
    * Tasks can be self assigned or assigned by a group consensus, and assignments should very rarely change hands once in progress
    * Failure to complete a task in a timely manner will result in questioning by other developers to try and understand where the problem lies and get the project back on track
    * Continued and deliberate failure to deliver will result in a formal report being submitted to the stakeholders 

5. Communication
    * Please try and use proper Slack tagging when posting a message
        * If you have a question for one developer but feel that everyone would benefit from the answer, please tag that person in a general channel
        * Please do not have extended discussions in group channels; move to direct messaging when necessary 
        * Don't be afraid to tag multiple people/everyone when an urgent issue arises or such steps seem otherwise necessary; we're a team!
    * If you are tagged in any way in Slack or on GitHub, please respond within the hour and stick around to answer followup questions
    * If you will be unable to answer messages for an extended period of time, please do one of the following:
        * Change your Slack status
        * Post a message in Slack
        * Talk to a maintainer/developer individually if need be
6. Rules for prioritizing the Product Backlog
    * The Product Backlog is updated by the Product Owner, with Developer involvement and feedback, as frequently as is necessary
    * As a general rule, please prioritize high value story outcomes
    * Try to keep things concise; don't overload the backlog (or developers) with tons of small things at once
        * Focus on necessary features before improvements
        * Don't bloat the sprint backlog and make it impossible to achieve our sprint goal

* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a

## Our Responsibilities

further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
